# overlord
==========
Overlords allow control of additional units.

Overlords are abstract creatures that extend a Centurion's control over a cluster. They allow the Centurion to exert control over his minions, and can also serve as lookouts, flying scouts and dropships for Cube Monkeys.

Overlord
--------
A Centurion cannot control an entire cluster by itself, as there are other nodes that it watches over and guides. Therefore, as a node's forces grow in number, it will need to spawn more Overlords regularly in order to create more monkeys. Further adding to their significance, the Overlord can use a special radar-sense tech to detect the life force and energy exhibited from hidden units.
